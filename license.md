## PHighlight

PHighlight is a syntaxHighlighter brush created by Leo Catonnet http://www.leocat.fr/

```
When I looked around the internet for a Processing brush for syntaxHighlighter I was disappointed to find only outdated and/or incomplete ones... Therefore I decided to make my own, moreover it could be enriching (it was!) and people could find it interesting (do you?). I created the brush and the theme and made them available online for free.
Even if PHighlight is free, please remember that Alex Gorbatchev's syntaxHighlighter is a donationware. If you like it, please donate there.
